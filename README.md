# Project Outline

## Purpose 
- This project forecasts stock exchange index prices based on real GDP per capita and inflation for a given index's country. The stock exchanges that we are looking at include: the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Euronext, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange of India, Frankfut Stock Exchange, Korea Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, Taiwan Stock Exchange, and Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  
- Reason why they selected their topic
- Description of their source of data
- Questions they hope to answer with the data

## Method of Project Completion
- Description of the communication protocol
  - The group communicates primarily through slack, google sheets, and zoom meetings at least twice week. 
- Tools being used for each section of the project  
  - Data Cleaning and Analysis: We will use pythons built in pandas library to clean and analyze our data.
  - Database Storage: Data will be stored using an Amazon RDS 
  - Machine Learning: The Machine Learning will be performed with Python using a Supervised Learning Model. 
  - Dashboard: The data will be visualized and presented using Tableau.
- How will the dashboard be built? 

  - As mentioned previously we plan on building and visualizing the dashboard through Tableau.

## Machine Learning Model Outline
- Which model did you choose and why? For this project, we will use a Supervised Learning Model. This is because supervised learning models are excellent tools to perform linear regression. Our Stock Index Price data, GDP data, and Inflation data are all chronological, and would work well to be analyzed through regression.
- How are you training your model? After joining our datasets into one dataset, we will split into train and test datasets using the ```train_test_split``` from ```sklearn.model_selection```. We will then instantiate linear and logistic regression models from ```sklearn```, and train the data through them.
- What is the model's accuracy? After constructing and training the model, we will set a goal of 75% accuracy to measure to model against. This threshold was chosen because while we want a model that has a higher accuracy than 50%, we cannot fully encompass all variables that may affect stock index prices, GDP and inflation. Unanticipated scenarios may have an effect on any or all of these targets. Thus, the 75% threshold gives us enough room for those factors.
- What are the model inputs and outputs?  Model inputs will include the real GDP per capita and inflation for the given stock exchange's country from the 1960s through today.  The output will be the stock exchange closing price.   
- How will the model work?  This model will learn off of the training data and will take in the inputs to determine our output variable through regression analysis.  In addition, in our analysis we can bucket the input variables based on periods of strong, medium, and weak GDP and periods of high, medium, and low inflation. The buckets for the respective categories will be used to help categorize economic conditions associated with given stock index prices.


## Database Outline
- Database structure outline/ schema

An AWS RDS will be used to store the data used throughout the duration of this project. To begin with, there are six datasets in total that we plan to work with:

    - indexInfo (Kaggle)
    - indexProcessed (Kaggle)
    - Inflation (World Bank)
    - GDP inflator (World Bank)
    - Nominal GDP (World Bank)
    - Population (World Bank)
    
GDP inflator, Nominal GPD, and Population are primarily going to be used for calculating real GDP for the stock indexes in the Kaggle data sets. The two Kaggle data sets will first be merged to get a full view of each of the 13 exchangesâ€™ opening and closing prices from 1960 to 2020. Then the Kaggle data will be merged with the world bank datasets to a table that can provide information on the different factors that affect the stock prices. The merge between the Kaggle data and the World Bank data will be on the "Country Name" column in the World Bank datasets, and the "Region" column in the Kaggle data set. 

- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- How will the machine learning module be connected to the provisional database?
